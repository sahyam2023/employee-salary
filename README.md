# Salary Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict employee salaries based on key features such as years of experience, age, education level, job title, and gender. The primary objective is to develop accurate regression models and explore additional analyses like clustering and classification.

## Project Structure

```
|-- salary_data.csv
|-- salaryprediction.ipynb
|-- README.md
```

## Files

- **dataset.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **salaryprediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and analysis.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `salaryprediction.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train regression models, and perform additional analyses.
3. Explore the visualizations and insights generated by the notebook.

## Model Selection

The Random Forest model was selected as the primary regression model due to its lowest mean squared error on the test set.

## Optional Steps (Clustering and Classification)

- Clustering was explored to group employees with similar characteristics.
- Classification was performed to predict salary ranges.

## Accuracy Check

The accuracy of the regression models was assessed using mean squared error. Additionally, classification accuracy and confusion matrices were used for classification models.

## Visualizations

- Scatter plots were employed to visualize actual vs. predicted salaries.
- Confusion matrices were used for classification evaluation.

## Conclusion

The project provides valuable insights into employee salary prediction, clustering, and classification. The chosen regression model, Random Forest, demonstrated promising results. Further analyses and model fine-tuning can enhance the accuracy and applicability of the predictions.
